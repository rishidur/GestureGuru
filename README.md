## Hand Gesture Recognition

This repository contains a Python implementation for hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The goal of this project is to accurately detect and recognize hand gestures, specifically counting the number of fingers shown. As well as a active FPS Counter that helps calculuate the speed you're video is running at! 

### Future Uses and Implementation

The potential applications for hand gesture recognition technology are vast and exciting. In the future, this project can be integrated into various domains, such as:

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** Enabling users to control devices or software applications using hand gestures, creating a more intuitive and immersive experience.
  
- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):** Enhancing user experiences in VR and AR environments by allowing natural interactions through hand gestures.

- **Robotics:** Allowing users to communicate with robots using gestures, improving collaboration between humans and machines in areas like manufacturing and healthcare.

I plan to enhance this project by implementing additional gesture recognition features, such as swiping, pinching, and other hand signals. By using machine learning techniques, I aim to create a more robust model that can learn from user interactions and adapt to different gestures over time.
